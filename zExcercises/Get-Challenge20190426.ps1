A CHALLENGE FROM THE DARK FACTION

The annual PowerShell Summit is fast approaching and at this late hour a
challenge has been delivered from the Dark Faction to those who feel they are
worthy of the title “Iron Scripter”. They doubt your skill and resolve. The Dark
Faction scripts in the shadows and has always felt they are the true champions.
The leaders of the Dark Faction have sent the Chairman an encoded message.

Here is an excerpt:

Rtsfi%nx%ymj%sj}y%ljsjwfynts%uqfyktwr%ktw%firnsnxywfyn{j%fzytrfynts3%%Rtsfi%xtq{jx%ywfinyntsfq%rfsfljrjsy%uwtgqj
rx%g~%qj{jwflnsl%ymj%3Sjy%Uqfyktwr3%%Kwtr%tzw%uwtyty~uj%-ymtzlm%qnrnyji.1%|j%hfs%uwtojhy%xnlsnknhfsy%gjsjknyx%yt

They are challenging the other factions and those who think they can be Iron
Scripters, to unravel their message. The Dark Faction has decided to have mercy
and are using a very simple Caesar Cipher. This is nothing more than a simple
character substitution encoding. The original characters have been adjusted by
some constant value up or down. Your challenge is to decode their message with
PowerShell.

You will first need to retrieve the text message from
http://bit.ly/DarkFactionMessage. You will also need to take blank lines into
account in your decoding.

The Dark Faction doesn’t think you are up to the challenge. Can you prove them
wrong?
