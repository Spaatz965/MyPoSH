A POWERSHELL CHALLENGE FOR CHALLENGES
Since the last PowerShell Summit, the Chairman has been offering PowerShell
scripting challenges to help hone your skills. Because not everyone is an
advanced PowerShell user, he has also been offering challenges for beginner
and intermediate level professionals.  Which brings us to this challenge which
is to find the previous challenges with PowerShell.

The JSON Journey
This website is powered by WordPress, which is a good thing for you. Most
recent WordPress installations include json support out-of-the-box. You can use
https://ironscripter.us/wp-json/wp/v2 as an entryway to discover everything you
can retrieve using json. You can discover how to get specific types of
information from the routes.

WordPress json routes

You should be able to get this information yourself with the information
provided thus far. You will need to be able to discover the routes so that you
can complete the following challenges. You will need to retrieve information
about categories and tags from the IronScripter web site.

Intermediate Challenge
For this level. all you need to do is write one or two PowerShell expressions to
achieve the desired result from a PowerShell prompt.

How many posts are there for each category?
How many posts are there for the beginner,intermediate, and advanced tags?
Display posts for the Challenge category showing when it was posted, the title,
the categories, the tags, excerpt, and link. Extra PowerShell Bonus points for
displaying categories and tags with their names.

Advanced Challenge
For advanced scripters, you should be able to accomplish everything in the
Intermediate challenge but in the form of an advanced function or two.  Include
an option to get the newest X number of challenges. The category and tag data in
your output must be real names and the excerpt should be simple text with no
HTML elements. For an extra challenge, write a control script to create a pretty
HTML page with links from the challenge post data.

As usual, please submit comments with links to your work and not actual solutions.
Good luck.
